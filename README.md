## Features

The Linear Algebra Manipulation library aims to support a range of core operations and functionalities, including but not limited to:

- **Matrix Operations**
  - Matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication
  - Transposition, inversion, determinant calculation
  - Row reduction (Gauss-Jordan elimination)
- **Vector Operations**
  - Dot product, cross product, vector norms
  - Projection and orthogonalization
- **Linear Systems**
  - Solving linear equations (Ax = b) using various methods
  - LU decomposition, QR decomposition
- **Advanced Operations**
  - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - Matrix exponentiation and logarithms

## Installation

This project is still in the development phase. To get started with the library:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-algebra-manipulation.git
   cd linear-algebra-manipulation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run setup** (optional):
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Usage

Here's a quick example to get started with matrix and vector manipulations:

```python
from linear_algebra import Matrix, Vector

# Creating matrices and vectors
A = Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = Matrix([[2, 0], [1, 3]])

# Basic matrix operations
C = A + B    # Matrix addition
D = A * B    # Matrix multiplication
A_inv = A.inverse()  # Matrix inversion

# Creating vectors
v = Vector([1, 2, 3])
w = Vector([4, 5, 6])

# Vector operations
dot_product = v.dot(w)
cross_product = v.cross(w)
```

## Roadmap

This library is under active development. Planned features include:

- Support for sparse matrices
- Performance optimization using NumPy and optional GPU support
- Extensions for advanced linear algebra topics, such as tensor operations
- Integration with popular data science libraries
